## Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Week 1 – Data Understanding & Import
**Objective:**  
Understand data types, inspect dataset structure, and import data into MySQL Workbench & Databricks.

**Activities:**  
- Downloaded student marks dataset from Kaggle.  
- Explored the data to identify types (categorical, numerical, boolean, etc.).  
- Loaded data into MySQL Workbench and Databricks.  
- Initialized GitHub repository, uploaded dataset, and started project tracking.  
- Documented data types and characteristics in README.  

**Tools Used:**  
Kaggle, MySQL Workbench, Databricks, GitHub  

**Deliverables:**  
- Dataset uploaded  
- MySQL schema created  
- GitHub repo initialized with project structure  
- Notes on data types & summary statistics

### Week 2 – Data Cleansing & Preprocessing
**Objective:**  
Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.

**Activities:**  
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries using SQL and PySpark (Databricks).  
- Normalized or standardized data where necessary.  
- Added derived columns such as average score and pass/fail status.  
- Pushed cleaned version to GitHub.  

**Concepts Covered:**  
- Data quality issues  
- Data cleansing techniques  
- Transformation best practices  

**Tools Used:**  
Databricks, MySQL, GitHub  

**Deliverables:**  
- Cleaned data tables  
- Jupyter/Databricks notebook with transformation steps  
- Updated GitHub repository with comments and commits  
- Data dictionary

### Week 3 – Data Integration & Analysis
**Objective:**  
Integrate data sources and perform meaningful analysis.

**Activities:**  
- Joined student mark data with other metadata (e.g., demographics).  
- Performed analysis to discover trends (e.g., gender vs. marks, performance per subject).  
- Created summary tables and metrics (AVG, MAX, MIN, COUNT).  

**Concepts Covered:**  
- Data integration methods (joins, merges, unions)  
- Aggregation and group-by techniques  
- Data storytelling  

**Tools Used:**  
Databricks, SQL, GitHub  

**Deliverables:**  
- Integrated dataset  
- Insightful visualizations within Databricks  
- Exported CSV summary tables  
- Final dataset ready for Looker Studio

### Week 4 – Visualization & Reporting
**Objective:**  
Build a compelling dashboard in Looker Studio to present insights.

**Activities:**  
- Connected Looker Studio to summary data (Google Sheets or BigQuery export).  
- Designed a clean dashboard showing:  
  - Average marks by gender  
  - Distribution per subject  
  - Pass/fail ratios  
  - Performance trends over time  
- Added interactive filters (e.g., by gender, subject, grade level).  
- Shared final dashboard link in GitHub.  

**Concepts Covered:**  
- Data visualization best practices  
- Interactive dashboard design  
- Storytelling with data  

**Tools Used:**  
Looker Studio, Google Sheets, GitHub  

**Deliverables:**  
- Looker Studio dashboard  
- GitHub final project (README, code, visuals)  
- Presentation-ready report PDF
